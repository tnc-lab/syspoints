**Syspoints** is a blockchain-based review and reputation platform built on **Syscoin**. It incentivizes users with **Syspoints Tokens** for contributing trusted, immutable reviews through a unique **Review-to-Earn** model.

## Key Functions

- **Decentralized Reviews:** Submit immutable feedback for stores and establishments directly on the Syscoin NEVM, ensuring data integrity through Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.
- **Incentivized Participation:** Earn **Syspoints Tokens** as a reward for verified and high-quality reviews.
- **Transparent Reputation:** Leverage blockchain transparency to ensure all ratings are authentic and tamper-proof.

## Usage

The following is a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
# Displays a Hardhat manual
npx hardhat help

# Run tests to ensure review logic works
npx hardhat test

# Generate a detailed report on gas consumption
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Start a local node for development
npx hardhat node

# Deploy the Syspoints contract
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
